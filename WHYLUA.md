<p>
  A common question we are asked is why write Vyne in Lua when you could use more popular scripting languages like JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Lua provides speed and
  ease of learning like no other language. Furthermore, embedding for the Lua language is more optimised and wider than embedding of Python, Ruby and JavaScript.
  
  Albeit we have to make certain sacrifices to use Lua (no array structure, poor stdlib, tables index at 1, etc...), the advantages (support for concurrency, very simple, designed for embedding, support for metatables, versatility of tables, etc..) outweigh the disadvantages.
