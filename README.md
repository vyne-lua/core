# Matter
Matter is a blazing-fast UI library for the web, creating effective, responsive and reflective applications by manipulating the reflexive
syntax of Lua to provide simplicity and control over your site.
    
Matter is comparable to JavaScript UI frameworks, such as Angular.JS, React and Vue.JS. Matter mimics the behaviour and is directly inspired
by these libraries.
